  <p>As a visual designer I spent my time working with campers and learning code at the same time. It is really fascinating to leran and watch other peoples progress at same time and become software engineer in codecamp one day. In my life I learned to work in a high tense environment - which was pretty awesome at the time. Trying to use same techniques at fcc to learn programming.</p>
